## Features

- Ability to route pages in a multiple page app/website.
- Simulate the experience in buying stuff online.
- Add/Remove to/from Cart.
- Check Out Cart.

## Objectives and Outcomes

- Apply React Router to a multi-page Shopping Cart Application. The two previous projects were single page apps only so this project was a bit hard for me. Made use of `Links`, `Router`, and `Hash Router` and successfully applied them.
- Learn and apply Styled Components. First time to use Styled Components. It is so fun and I think I am gonna stick with this one for the mean time.
- Make use of the previously learned React Hooks like useState and useEffect. I rarely used useEffect on this project but it became very handy in the ScrollToTop helper. useState is a given and I really love the "stateful" thinking in React.
- Make use of useContext! It's so fun to not prop drill.

## Development

Technologies:

- Bootstrapped with `create-react-app`
- React Router using `react-router-dom`
- React Icons using `react-icons`
- CSS
- New: TypeScript
- New: React Testing Library
- Removed: Styled Components using `styled-components`
